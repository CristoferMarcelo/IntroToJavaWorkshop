		// Make a new robot, and set it's pen down.

		// Set the robot speed to 100

		//  COUNT. Make an int variable to count how many times the loop has repeated
		//         Set its start value to 0

	       //  LOOP. Start a while loop to repeat all of the code below ONE time

			   // TURN RIGHT     Turn the robot 1/8 of a circle
		
			   // MOVE           Move the robot 64 pixels

			   // TURN LEFT      Turn the robot 40 degrees to the LEFT

			   // DRAW FLAME     Move the robot the distance in the variable flameSize

			   //                Turn the robot 170 degrees

			   //                Move the robot the distance in the variable flameSize (again)

			   // TURN RIGHT     Turn the robot 64 degrees to the RIGHT

			   // MOVE           Move the robot the distance in the variable baseSize

			   // INCREASE COUNT. Increase the count by 1

		//  End the while loop here

		// TEST.  Run the program. Check that your shape is the same as the first picture in the recipe.
		//        This is one arm of the ninja star.

		// COLOR. Change the Robot's pen color so that the flame is a different color to the rest of the star.
		//        Run the program again. Check the second picture in the recipe.

		// LOOP.  When you have one arm looking right, CHANGE your LOOP to repeat 25 times and run the program.
		
		// VARIATIONS:
		// * Try changing some of the numbers in the code!
		// * Ex: Increase the number of times the loop repeats
