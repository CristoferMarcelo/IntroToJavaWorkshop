		// Create a new Robot
		
		// PEN.   Set your robot's pen down

		// SPEED. Set the robot to go at max speed (100)

		// COUNT. Create an int variable that will count how many lines of the spiral we have drawn.
		//        Start its value as 0.

		// LOOP. Start a while loop to repeat the COLOR, DRAW, TURN, and COUNT 
		//       code below until 50 lines have been drawn

			// COLOR.   Have the robot set a random pen color

			// DRAW.    Move the robot (5*count) pixels
			//          "count" is the name of the variable you created earlier

			// TURN.    Turn the robot (360/7) degrees to the right

			// COUNT.   Increase the count of how many lines have been drawn so far ( count+=1 )

			// WIDTH.   Change the robot pen width to the current value of the count variable


		//  End the while loop here


		// Run the program.
		// VARIATIONS:
		//  * Try changing some of the numbers in the code!
		//  * Ex: What does changing the 360/7 to 360/3 do?
