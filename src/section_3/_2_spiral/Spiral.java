		// Create a new Robot
		// HINT: Make sure to import the robot by clicking on the red "x" on line 9 and clicking "Import 'Robot' (org.jointheleague.graphical.robot)"
	
		// Set your robot's pen down

		// SPEED. Set the robot to go at max speed (100)

		// COUNT. Create an int variable that will count how many lines of the spiral we have drawn.
			//        Start its value as zero.

		// LOOP. Start a while loop to repeat the COLOR, DRAW, TURN, and COUNT code below until 50 lines have been drawn

			// COLOR.   Have the robot set a random pen color:      setRandomPenColor()

			// DRAW.    Move the robot (5*count) pixels
			//          count is the name of the variable you created earlier

			// TURN.    Turn the robot (360/7) degrees to the right

			// COUNT.   Increase the count of how many lines have been drawn so far ( count+=1 )

			// Change the robot pen width to the current value of the count variable


		//  End the while loop here


		// Run the program.
		// Check the pattern against the picture in the recipe. If it matches, you are done!
		// VARIATIONS:
		//  * Try changing some of the numbers in the code!
		//  * Ex: What does changing the 360/7 to 360/3 do?
